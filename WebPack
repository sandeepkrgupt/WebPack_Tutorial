There are problems with managing JavaScript projects:

It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not function properly.
If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.
Let's use webpack to manage these scripts instead.
